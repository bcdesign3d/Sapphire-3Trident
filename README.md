ðŸ’Ž Sapphireâ€‘3 Trident â€“ Project Overview
The Sapphireâ€‘3 Trident is a CoreXY 3D printer modification developed by BCDesign3D, designed to bring advanced stability, modularity, and performance to the Sapphire-3 platform. This upgrade incorporates a triple Z-drive motion system and many mechanical improvements inspired by the well-known Voron Trident design.

Key Features:

Triple Z-Drive System: Provides enhanced stability, especially for taller prints, and helps maintain gantry alignment during motion or power loss.

Voron-Inspired Architecture: Many components and ideas have been adapted from the original Voron Design Trident, including layout concepts, motion mechanics, and structural elementsâ€”bridging proven design with custom modularity.

CoreXY Motion: Retains the speed and precision of CoreXY kinematics, optimized with improved frame rigidity and belt routing.

Open-Source & Modular: All CAD files, STLs, and documentation are shared openly, allowing builders to assemble, modify, and further develop the design with ease.

Print-Ready Frame: Designed to integrate seamlessly with the Sapphireâ€‘3 structure while introducing performance and maintenance enhancements.
