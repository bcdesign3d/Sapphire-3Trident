# ðŸ’Ž Sapphireâ€‘3 Trident

The **Sapphireâ€‘3 Trident** is a CoreXY 3D printer modification developed by **BCDesign3D**, designed to upgrade the Sapphire-3 platform with a triple Z-drive system and many proven mechanical features inspired by the original [Voron Design Trident](https://vorondesign.com/).

This project blends the compact modularity of the Sapphire Pro SP3 with the precision, reliability, and expandability of the Voron Trident concept â€” all in an open-source package.
